## About The Project

### Problem Statement

#### Background

An aviation analytics company has been tasked with analyzing the trends and patterns in passenger traffic for the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The company aims to understand the temporal dynamics of air traffic passenger counts to help the airport manage resources efficiently and plan for future capacity.

#### Objective

The goal is to conduct a time series analysis on the SFO air traffic passenger statistics dataset. The specific objectives are:

1. Load the historical air traffic passenger data.
2. Inspect the data to understand its structure and type.
3. Process the data to facilitate time series analysis by converting date information into a datetime object and setting it as an index.
4. Perform a preliminary analysis to look for patterns or trends in passenger counts over time.
5. Compute the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to quantify the correlation of passenger counts with its past values.
6. Visualize the ACF and PACF to assist in identifying the order of an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for future forecasting tasks.

#### Data

The dataset is presumed to be in CSV format, containing monthly passenger counts over several years. It is expected to have at least two columns: 'Date' and 'Total Passenger Count'.

### Solution

#### Implementation

To solve this problem, a Jupyter Notebook was set up with structured Python code, split into several sections for clarity and maintainability:

1. **Setup and Configuration:**
   
   Python's data manipulation (pandas), numerical operations (numpy), and plotting libraries (matplotlib and seaborn) are imported, alongside statistical tools from the `statsmodels` library to compute and plot ACF and PACF.

2. **Helper Functions:**
   
   Custom functions are defined to perform repetitive tasks:
   - `load_and_prepare_data()`: Reads the CSV file, parses dates, and sets the date column as the index.
   - `display_dataset_head_and_info()`: Displays the first few rows and summarizes the dataset.
   - `compute_and_print_acf_pacf()`: Computes ACF and PACF up to a specified lag and prints the values.
   - `plot_acf_pacf()`: Plots the ACF and PACF to visually analyze the correlations.

3. **Main Analysis:**
   
   The analysis is initiated by setting the path to the dataset and the number of lags for the ACF/PACF analysis. The data is loaded and inspected, followed by computing and plotting the ACF and PACF.

#### Results

Upon executing the notebook, the following results are expected:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection:**
   
   The dataset should be correctly loaded with dates parsed. The initial inspection would reveal the number of records, column data types, and a peek at the first few entries.

2. **Data Processing:**
   
   The date column would now serve as the index of the dataset, enabling time series manipulation and analysis.

3. **ACF and PACF Computation:**
   
   ACF and PACF values should indicate how many past months' passenger counts are significantly correlated with the current month, providing insights into potential seasonal patterns or trends.

4. **Visualization:**
   
   The plotted ACF and PACF charts would help visualize these correlations and identify the need for differencing (indicating non-stationarity) or the order of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components for an ARIMA model.

#### Conclusion

This analysis would give a foundational understanding of the temporal structure in the SFO air traffic passenger data. The insights gleaned from the ACF and PACF would inform subsequent predictive modeling steps, critical for forecasting future passenger traffic and making informed decisions for airport operations and management.

The code presented is structured to perform a basic time series analysis on air traffic passenger data using a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes loading the dataset, preparing the data, inspecting the first few rows, and then calculating and plotting the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for a given number of lags. Here is an exhaustive explanation of each part of the code:

#### Setup and Configuration

The first section of the notebook is dedicated to setting up the environment:

1. **Import Libraries**: This block imports the necessary Python libraries:
   - `numpy` for numerical operations,
   - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis,
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization, and
   - `acf`, `pacf`, `plot_acf`, and `plot_pacf` from `statsmodels` for statistical models used in time series analysis.
   The `sns.set(style="whitegrid")` line sets the visual theme of seaborn plots to have a white grid background.

#### Helper Functions

The second section defines several helper functions to streamline the analysis:

1. **`load_and_prepare_data(filepath)`**: This function attempts to load a dataset from the given `filepath`, convert the 'Date' column to a `datetime` object, and set this column as the index of the DataFrame. If the file is not found or another error occurs, it will return `None`.

2. **`display_dataset_head_and_info(dataset)`**: This function prints the first five rows of the dataset, the shape (dimensions), and data types of the columns.

3. **`compute_and_print_acf_pacf(series, nlags)`**: This function computes the ACF and PACF values for a given number of lags (`nlags`) and prints them out. These are important for understanding the correlation of the dataset with its past values, which is crucial for time series forecasting.

4. **`plot_acf_pacf(series, nlags)`**: This function creates and displays two plots: one for the ACF and another for the PACF, up to `nlags` number of lags. These plots help visualize how the data is related to its past values over different time lags.

#### Main Analysis

The main analysis begins with setting the constants:

1. **File Path**: The `FILE_PATH` constant holds the path to the dataset file.
2. **Number of Lags**: `N_LAGS` defines the number of lags to consider when computing and plotting the ACF and PACF.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement ensures that the following block of code runs only if the script is executed as the main program. This is a common practice in Python to prevent certain code from being run when the module is imported.

Inside this block, the code performs the following steps:

1. **Load and Prepare Data**: Calls `load_and_prepare_data()` with the defined file path to load the data.

2. **Data Inspection**: If data is loaded successfully (i.e., not `None`), the `display_dataset_head_and_info()` function is called to show initial data points and information.

3. **Data Types**: It prints out the data types after the 'Date' column has been transformed into a `datetime` object and set as the index.

4. **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation**: It computes the ACF and PACF using `compute_and_print_acf_pacf()` for the 'Total Passenger Count' column with the number of lags specified by `N_LAGS`.

5. **Plotting ACF and PACF**: Lastly, it visualizes the ACF and PACF with the `plot_acf_pacf()` function to help identify any autocorrelation in the time series data that can be used for modeling.

This notebook structure, with separated concerns (setup, helper functions, and main analysis), promotes readability and modularity, making the analysis clear and easy to follow or extend.
